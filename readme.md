Rigid-as-possible shape deformation in openFrameworks. A wrapper around code from [Ryan Schmidt](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~rms/software/Deform2D/index.html).

This code uses WML [wild magic library](http://www.geometrictools.com/) and opencv for some faster matrix operations.  In the future, we'd like to remove the depency on WML, since it's an older, modified version of the library.
